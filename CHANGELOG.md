## Enhancements

- [Theme] Themes are now simple `AnyObject`. You just define (non static) attributes
on it and apply them on a `UIView` usting the new `styleClass` attribute.
- [IB] To apply a style right from InterfaceBuilder, you now define `themeClassName`
in addition to `styleName`.
- [Style] Replaced `applyStyle` with `styleInline`.
While the former was totally replacing the style, the newer appends style to `styleClass`.
